# scootalite

**Scootalite** is a podcast manager platform, uses RSS feed to load/store and play podcasts.

the latest version is deployed via **surge.sh** on [scootalite](https://scootalite.surge.sh/)
This repo contains the code of the front-end bit, which is coded in react.

At the moment this project is hosted on a subfolder in my personal website.


this is the react version of one of my previous projects in vue2 [aScoota](https://ascoota.surge.sh), it is way easier to maintain and the code is way less.
